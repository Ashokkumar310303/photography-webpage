# Photography Webpage

This is a simple photography webpage I created for learning HTML and CSS. The project is designed to showcase a photography portfolio with a clean, modern layout. It aims to highlight various photography categories, including nature, portraits, and urban photography. This project helped me improve my skills in building responsive web layouts and styling with CSS.

- **Navigation**: Includes a navigation bar to quickly access different sections of the website.
- **Styling**: The page has been styled to have a clean, professional look with smooth hover effects.

## Technologies Used
